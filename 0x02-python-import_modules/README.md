# 0x02-python-import_modules
## Tasks
0.  Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3
    - You have to use print function with string format to display integers
    - You have to assign:
        - the value 1 to a variable called a
        - the value 2 to a variable called b
        - and use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions add and print
    - a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 1 and another b = 2
    - You can only use the word add_0 once in your code
    - You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
    - Your code should not be executed when imported - by using __import__
1.  Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.
    - Do not use the function print (with string format to display integers) more than 4 times
    - You have to define:
        - the value 10 to a variable a
        - the value 5 to a variable b
        - and use those two variables only, as arguments when calling functions (including print)
    - a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 10 and another b = 5
2.  Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.
    - The output should be:
      - Number of argument(s) followed by argument (if number is one) or arguments (otherwise), followed by
      - : (or . if no arguments were passed) followed by
      - a new line, followed by (if at least one argument),
      - one line per argument:
        - the position of the argument (starting at 1) followed by :, followed by the argument value and a new line
3.  Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments
4.  Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc (please download it locally).
5.  Write a program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.
6.  Write a program that imports all functions from the file calculator_1.py and handles basic operations.
7.  
8.  Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
9.  Write a program that prints the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a new line.
